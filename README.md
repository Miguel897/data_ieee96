# data_ieee96

This repository includes the data of the IEEE RTS-96 test system [1] modified to accommodate 19 wind farms as proposed in [2]. This power systems includes 73 nodes and 120 transmission lines. Each data file is explained below: 

- thermal_ieee96.csv: data on thermal generators including minimum and maximum outputs, variable cost and ramping limits

- lines_ieee96.csv: data on transmission lines including susceptance and maximum capacity

- load_ieee96.csv: data on hourly electricity demand at each node of the system for a whole year

- wind_ieee96.csv: data on hourly wind power generatino at each node of the system for a whole year
